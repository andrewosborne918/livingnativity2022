  <!-- Paragraph Description -->
  <p class="paragraph-description">
    As you round the corner and come past the building, you will see shepherds in the field. Simple shepherds were tending their sheep. They were going about their daily work when God’s messengers came to them. Catching them off-guard, the shepherds
    were afraid. But the angels said, “Do not be afraid. For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for
    you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And with this, there was a multitude of angels singing and praising God. So the shepherds went on their way to Bethlehem to see this child.
    <br>
    <br>
    And in the distance behind the shepherds, your attention might be seized by the illuminated cross on the top of the hill. The story of Christ’s birth is about more than just a peasant girl and a young man. It’s about more than shepherds, more
    even than the birth of a baby. As we will hear soon, this birth story is about bringing God’s full plan of life and salvation through the birth, life, death, and resurrection of this One named Jesus. As we will hear soon, this birth story is
    about bringing all people together through the birth, life, death, and resurrection of this One named Jesus.
