  <!-- Paragraph Description -->
  <p class="paragraph-description">
    A left turn brings you to a small, unimpressive house.  It belongs to a peasant family.  Inside is a woman name Mary.  She was a faithful follower of God but hadn’t really done anything too impressive in her life.  Yet.
    <br>
    <br>
    One night, without any warning, a divine messenger appeared to Mary.  It was the angel, Gabriel.  The Bible says that Mary was confused and scared at first.  Wouldn’t you be?!  She had never had anything like this happen to her before!  Gabriel told her, ‘Do not be afraid, you have found favor with God.  You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus’ (Luke 1:28-29).  Mary was engaged to marry a man name Joseph.  Gabriel’s message created all kinds of problems!  Mary asked, ‘How will this be since I am a virgin?’  After explaining more, Gabriel told her, ‘Nothing will be impossible with God.”  Mary said, “I am the Lord’s servant.  May it be to me as you have said” (Luke 1).  This would be no ordinary child – God was fulfilling his promise to give His people more.
