  <!-- Paragraph Description -->
  <p class="paragraph-description">
    As you turn right around the corner, a different sight comes into view.  There are no Christmas lights, no familiar markings of Christmas.  There is only a man speaking.  A few people listening.  His name is Isaiah.  He was God’s spokesman, called a prophet.  He spoke on God’s behalf.  To us this type of speaking seems unusual.  To the people of God, it was a blessing.  In order for them to trust that the prophet spoke for God, his words need to come true. (To learn more, read Deuteronomy 18:20-22 in the Bible)
    <br>
    <br>
    One of the most famous things that Isaiah said was, “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and will call his name ‘Immanuel’ (Isaiah 7:14).  Immanuel means ‘God is with us.’  Isaiah was talking to the disobedient King of Israel and telling him that God would come and be with his people.  This was a promise, a promise that there would be something more.  There would be more in what God had for them, that what this King could provide.
